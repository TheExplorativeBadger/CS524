    "So, we next find two vectors for each face. To do this is easy. Since we have 3 vertices which define each plane, we know each vertex lies in the plane, and hence, vectors connecting two of the three points would  certainly lie within the plane.

For this, we notice that the point (0,0,0) is on the correct side of each face of the polyhedron as it resides in the center.

    "To begin solving this problem, we first determine the decision variables and place constraints, as close to standard form as we can. When thinking about the points in this model where we have a choice, it comes down to deciding how many units of germanium to melt for both methods, $M_1$ and $M_2$. We then notice that all intake of particular grades of transistors comes down to linear combinations of $M_1$ and $M_2$, which we can manipulate a little bit to get the entire model into standard LP form. Since the original connstraints for transistor quality are $\\geq$, we will manipulate the expression to obtain an equivalent $\\leq$. Specifically:\n",

    "To add onto part (a), this problem adds a couple different constraints. The first thing worth mentioning is that I chose to use two separate variables to model the refiring process, $R_1$ and $R_2$, which are the secondary step option of $M_1$ and $M_2$, respectively. I chose this because I felt it was important to differentiate which method the refired transistor came from originally since the original two methods each have different grade distributions. We can then once again represent the quantity of each transistor grade using the 4 mentioned decision variables. The coefficients for each $R_x$ are derived from the linear combination of likelihood of a particular grade given the method used, multiplied by the likelihood of becoming the target grade after refire.
