It works like this: The interview (10AM - 3PM) is divided into anumber of 20-minute time slots that may be used for 1-on-1 meetings with the candidate. There is lso a one-hour time slot in the middle of the day where 3 employees take the candidate out for lunch.**\n",

A doodle poll was sent to the 15 senior employees to figure out their availability. See hw3data.ipynb for the incidence matrix describing the availabilities of each employee at the various time slots.**\n",

    "When we take some time to think through this problem and process the important information and objectives, we can see this problem effectively becomes a transportation problem. In this case, we can reduce this problem to a more generalized template. We notice that we can represent each employee as a source node since the employee is providing the availability, and represent each time slot as a sink node demanding availability. We can then place constraints on the edges to represent things such as capacity and availabilitiy restrictions. Finally, this problem is a maximization problem and each cost coefficient will just be 1, thus the LP can be thought of as wanting to maximize the number of edges that have capacity on them in order to fill as many time slots as possible. Thus, we formulate our model as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $x_{ij}$ represent the flow of time-availability going from employee i to project j where $i \\in [1,15]$ and $j \\in [a,m]$ (13 time slots). We can apply constraints to these flow variables to model the particularities of our system. We will cover these constraints in 3 parts, supply, capacity, and demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\textbf{Supply:}$\n",
    "\n",
    "For supply, we know that each employee can only fill one time slot, so the sum of all flow outgoing from that employee's source node must sum to one with no negative flow. Although we would like for all of these to be met with equality, if there is a feasible solution, the solver will maximize it, so we can instead save ourself half of the constraints by using the inequality constraint. So, we can model that as follows, remembering our convention for the flow variable denotations:\n",

So the net flow in conjunction with initial values needs to be above a lower bound for each agency.
