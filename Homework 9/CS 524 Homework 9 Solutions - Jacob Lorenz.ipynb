    "In hindsight, this result makes sense. Option 5 has the highest return at 22\\%, so it seems natural to want to put as much as possible into it; however, it comes with the downside that you need an equivalent investment total amongst Options 2, 4, and 6, which have a lower expected return than Option 3. Given that Option 2 is the worst return, the model does not even consider it. Additionally, Option 6 has the highest return among 2, 4, and 6, so it makes sense that we use the maximum investment in Option 6 and then fill the remainder of the equality requirement with Option 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of this is then traded off with the second highest returning Option, Option 3 at 17\\%. The expected return of Option 3 is the average of returns between Option 5 and Option 6; however, it is higher than the average return between Option 5 and Option 4. Therefore, to offset the loss taken on investing in Option 4 due to the requirement for it having a minimum due to investing in Option 5, the allocation amount to Option 3 is the largest. If the maximum investment in Option 6 increased by $\\$$1 Million, we would see no loss from removing $\\$$2 Million from Option 3 and allocating an additional $\\$$1 Million to each Option 5 and Option 6. If the maximum investment in Option 6 decreased by $\\$$1 Million; however, we would see a larger relative allocation to Option 3 instead of a higher allocation split between Option 4 and Option 5."

    "As part of its weekly production, a paint company produces five batches of paints, always the same, for some big clients who have a stable demand.  Every paint batch is produced in a single production process, all in the same blender that needs to be cleaned between each batch.  The durations of blending paint batches 1 to 5 are 40, 35, 45, 32 and 50 minutes respectively.  The cleaning times depend of the colors and the paint types.  For example, a long cleaning period is required if an oil-based paint is produced after a water-based paint, or to produce white paint after a dark color.  The times are given in minutes in the following matrix $A$ where $A_{ij}$ denotes the cleaning time after batch $i$ if it is followed by batch $j$.\n",
